Data : Unprocessed Data and Unorganized Data

Data Scale : Raw Data --> BigData

The Engineering Approach that we are using to solve this kind of big problem is making use of Distributed Computing

1. Data Engineering: An Engineering approach which will curate the whole unprocessed data to organized data
    1. Data ingestion:
        1. Flume, kafka, Apache Nifi, etc.
    2. Data warehousing
    3. Data Transformation --> Data type transformation --Date
    4. Data Indexing
    5. Data Fingerprinting
    6. Data tagging
    7. Data profiling

ETL Pipeline --> Snowflake, Informatica, Aws Glue(Automate Process above)
--> Data Engineers (70-80% role)
--> Big data technologies 
    -- Platforms => hadoop, Spark.
    -- Tools => Ingesting tools, Event streaming tools.
    -- Programming languages => Scala(Efficient), Python
        -- Framework (packages)=> Pyspark, SparkML, SparkSQL, Hive, Impala
